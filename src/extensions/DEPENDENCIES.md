# Extension Dependencies

The ThinkMate extensions require one additional dependency for the achievement celebration system:

## Required Package

```bash
npm install canvas-confetti
```

or

```bash
yarn add canvas-confetti
```

## TypeScript Types (optional)

If using TypeScript, you may also want to install the types:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/canvas-confetti
```

## Why This Dependency?

The `canvas-confetti` library is used in the **MilestonesCelebration** component to create delightful confetti animations when users unlock achievements. This adds to the "magical moments" that make the thinking experience memorable.

## All Other Dependencies

All other required dependencies (React, Framer Motion, etc.) are already included in the main ThinkMate project.
